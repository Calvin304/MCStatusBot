# MCStatusBot
Discord Bot to Check Status' of Minecraft Servers

this expects a file config.json of the format
{
    "token": "Your-Token-Here",
    "author": {
        "name":"Your-Discord-Name-Here",
        "id": "Your-Discord-Id-Here"
    }
}
and a file servers.json which should contain 
{"guilds": []}

these files arent here because .gitignore is dumb
